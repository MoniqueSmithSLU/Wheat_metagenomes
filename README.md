# Wheat_metagenomes
This repository is for data and scripts for an upcoming paper about how wheat breeding during the green revolution has impacted the microbiomes. This is currently in review at Environmental Microbiomes so this repository will be made public upon acceptance and I link to the DOI will be put here.
There are two R scripts, one titled ALL_R_code.R and another called Loop_script.R. The first has code for all data handing, statistical analysis and figure creation for the paper except for som data in Loop_script.R which was used for Table 3 and Table S2.
